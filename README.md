# Classification of Pulsar Stars

This repository contains all relevant files for the second capstone project as part of Springboard's Data Science Bootcamp.

## Recruiters/Companies/Hiring Managers, please read:
The main culmination of the Data Science Bootcamp is the creation of the capstone projects, of which there are 2 and the Beer Recommendation Engine is the second and final project.

The main files of interest are in the Final folder, which contains the following:
* Machine learning code in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.
* A final report of around 10 pages to communicate the overall findings of the project.
* A slide deck to presenting the project and findings.

In addition, there are additional folders which contain the follow:
* algo_tests include Python scripts for running benchmark tests across all the available recommendation algorithms so get an understanding of how each performs with the dataset.
* Milestone Report 1 includes:
  * EDA folder for the code (Jupyter notebook) and visualizations for the Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Scraper scripts folder for the Python scripts written to scrape all data relevant to the project
  * Miletone Report 1 document (.docx) for the preliminary findings and analysis that summarizes the EDA process.
  * Milestone Report 1 slides to communicate the relevant process and findings

### Beer Recommendation Engine
The beer recommendation engine was designed as the second capstone project for Springboard's Data Science Bootcamp, where the main goal is to provide accurate beer recommendations to users. The project includes various elements. First, the data collection process being scraped from the web and stored to a database using cloud services via Amazon Web Services. Second, an exploratory data analysis to get a better understanding of the data. Third, and finally, the design and implementation of a machine learning recommendation engine. For those interested, the dataset is too large to upload to GitHub but you can feel free to reach out to me to obtain a copy.
